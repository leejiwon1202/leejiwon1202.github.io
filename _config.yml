          Students who are eager to delve deeper into deep learning participated in the study sessions, and we held weekly team presentations where each group summarized and presented what they had studied during the week.   
          We also conducted a project where team members collected pictures of rock-paper-scissors gestures to create a classification model with high accuracy.
